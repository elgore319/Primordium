Im thinking of making a separate world changing event (similar to Hardmode)
for after moonlord is defeated (or maybe someother boss idk yet) 
but with this change I want to completely revamp hell and make it "freeze over" to give some life to
the world, this change will effect the whole biome.  Now with the spirit of this change I think it 
necessary to remember that the player may still need access to all hell exclusive items.  In that case 
I will make sure all frozen varients can be shimmered to their original form, but with that in mind
I need to remember to lock this shimmer before this new mode is entered, that way they cant obtain the frozen
varients too early (adding to the surprise)

Lore:
- We need a reason for hell to freeze. Could be because of a boss, or some other reason.

Item Concepts:
- Frozen HellStone (could give a frozen debuff instead of spilling lava)
- change all magma to obsidian
- Ash block changes to a new block (well call it "hellsnow" until I come up with a better name)
- I want to make an Item that most enemies drop, that also has lore implications (crafting too) maybe like
"The Chill" or something thats the reason for hell freezing, not sure, maybe it could make an accessory that
freezes you and powers you up or something not really sure yet

Enemy Concepts:
- Frozen Demons/Frost Demons (I could make an easter egg for the dragon ball Frost Demons like Frieza)
- Obsidian slime (I was thinking about adding ice slimes but this seems smarter, since they were originally magma slimes)
- Imps will definitely need a reskin as well
- Obsidian Bats (Duh)

Boss Concepts:
- I think it would be cool to have the wall of flesh be affected by the biome change
- Obviously a new boss will also be cool, so this is a must (Maybe something like frieza?!)
- New Hell themed event???
